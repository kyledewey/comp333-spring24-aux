    <h1>Step-by-Step Instructions</h1>

    <h2>Step 1: Download Needed Code</h2>
    <p>
      Download everything from the links above into a single directory.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 2: Read and Understand Provided Code</h2>
    <p>
      For this assignment, you'll be working with an <b>immutable</b> linked list implementation, a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure">persistent data structure</a>.
      While you (hopefully!) are familiar with linked lists, this implementation is likely very different from the one you're used to.
      Notably:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Existing lists cannot be modified (the immutable/persistant part).
        Operations which would normally modify the list (like <code>append</code>) instead return a <i>new</i> list, reflecting the result of the operation.
        For example, <code>[1, 2].append([3, 4, 5])</code> returns the list <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code>, leaving the original lists <code>[1, 2]</code> and <code>[3, 4, 5]</code> unmodified.
      </li>
      <li>
        Instead of using <code>null</code> to represent the end of a list, we instead use an instance of class <code>Nil</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Class <code>Cons</code> corresponds to the normal <code>Node</code> class, with the caveat that <code>tail</code> (representing the rest of the list) cannot be <code>null</code>.
        Per the prior bullet, if we want to represent a list where <code>tail</code> is empty, then we should have an instance of <code>Nil</code> there.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is no special class holding the head of a list.
        Instead, <code>Cons</code> and <code>Nil</code> are both fully-featured lists in and of themselves.
        This is one of the reasons we use <code>Nil</code> instead of <code>null</code>, as we can meaningfully call methods on <code>Nil</code> (unlike <code>null</code>).
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>Cons</code> and <code>Nil</code> both implement the <code>ImmutableList</code> interface.
        If something wants to take a list as a parameter, it should take an <code>ImmutableList</code>; which could be either an empty list (<code>Nil</code>) or a non-empty list (<code>Cons</code>).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In addition to the above bullets, there is a provided <a href="https://junit.org/junit4/">JUnit 4</a> test suite in <code>ImmutableListTest.java</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 3: (Try to) Compile and Run the Tests</h2>
    <p>
      You will need to compile and run the code.
      If the code fails to compile, do not try to run it; it either won't work, or you'll run an old, previously-compiled version.
      The two commands below compile and run the code, respectively.
      The two commands are slightly different, depending on what system you're running with.
      If you're on a <b>UNIX-based system (e.g., Mac OS X, Linux)</b>, use:
    </p>
<pre>
javac -cp .:hamcrest-2.2.jar:junit-4.13.jar -Xlint:all ImmutableList.java Cons.java Nil.java ImmutableListTest.java
java -cp .:hamcrest-2.2.jar:junit-4.13.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ImmutableListTest
</pre>
    <p>
      If you're on <b>Windows command prompt</b>, use these two commands, which use semicolons instead of colons:
    </p>
<pre>
javac -cp .;hamcrest-2.2.jar;junit-4.13.jar -Xlint:all ImmutableList.java Cons.java Nil.java ImmutableListTest.java
java -cp .;hamcrest-2.2.jar;junit-4.13.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ImmutableListTest
</pre>
    <p>
      If you're on <b>Windows Powershell</b>, use these two commands, which put some arguments in single quotes:
    </p>
<pre>
javac -cp '.;hamcrest-2.2.jar;junit-4.13.jar' -Xlint:all ImmutableList.java Cons.java Nil.java ImmutableListTest.java
java -cp '.;hamcrest-2.2.jar;junit-4.13.jar' org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ImmutableListTest
</pre>
    <p>
      If all tests are passing, you'll see output like the following:
    </p>
<pre>
JUnit version 4.13
....................................
Time: 0.053

OK (36 tests)
</pre>
    <p>
      If tests are failing, the output will instead show which tests are failing.
      From there, you can look to see what those tests are doing in the test suite (<code>ImmutableList.java</code>), which will inform you of what needs to be modified.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Note that the provided code <b>will not compile as provided</b>.
      It's missing the implementations of multiple methods which are needed to make the tests compile.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 4: Implement Missing Code, with Restrictions</h2>
    <p>
      Add code to <code>Cons.java</code> and <code>Nil.java</code> to get it to compile and pass the tests.
      Specifically, you need to implement the following methods for each:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>length</code>: returns the length of a list.
        As a hint, empty lists (<code>Nil</code>) have length <code>0</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>sum</code>: returns the sum of all the elements of the list.
        For our purposes, empty lists (<code>Nil</code>) have a sum of <code>0</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>append</code>: appends two lists together, returning a new list.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>contains</code>: returns <code>true</code> if the given list contains the given element, else <code>false</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Example calls to these methods are in <code>ImmutableList.java</code>.
    </p>
    <h3>Restrictions</h3>
    <p>
      For full credit, your code:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Can only modify <code>Cons.java</code> and <code>Nil.java</code>; I'll only look at these two files when grading, so any other modifications will be ignored.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>CANNOT</b> use loops (no <code>for</code>, foreach, <code>while</code>, or <code>do-while</code>).
        Any code I provided that uses loops is ok, and should not be modified.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>CANNOT</b> use conditionals (no <code>if</code>, <code>switch</code>, or ternary (<code>(...) ? ... : ...</code>)).
        Any code I provided that uses loops is ok, and should not be modified.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These restrictions will force you to use recursion for a correct solution, and will also force you to fully exploit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_dispatch">virtual dispatch</a> (also known as dynamic dispatch, polymorphism, and ad-hoc polymorphism).
      While these restrictions will likely be annoying, it will force you to use a key object-oriented feature (virtual dispatch), as well as serve as good practice for later in the course (recursion).
    </p>
    <h3>Hints</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It's recommended to first write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_stub">method stubs</a> for all the methods you need to implement.
        This will get all the code compiling, but the tests won't pass.
        This is still progress, and this way you can focus on getting one set of tests (or even just one test) to pass at a time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mentally, whenever you think something like:
<pre>
if (list is empty) {
  do empty thing
} else {
  do non-empty thing
}
</pre>
...you must instead use virtual dispatch.
For this example, <code>do empty thing</code> would go into the corresponding method definition in <code>Nil</code>, and <code>do non-empty thing</code> would go into the corresponding method definition in <code>Cons</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        While you only have to implement 4 operations, each of these has a different implementation for <code>Cons</code> and <code>Nil</code>, so you really have to implement 8 methods.
        That said, the body of each of these methods need only be <b>a single line of code</b>.
        If you need much more than a single line for any method, you are likely making this more difficult than it needs to be.
        If you're stuck, talk to me.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once you think you have an operation working, run the tests again using the instructions in step 3.
        It's probably best to focus on getting one set of tests (or even just one test) passing at a time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Specific to <code>contains</code>, you do not need to use <code>if</code>, though you'll need to use the short-circuiting nature of <code>||</code>.
        Specifically you can implement this using something like the following:
<pre>
  return head == value || &lt;&ltrecursive call&gt;&gt;;
</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>

      Please submit this file along with the other files.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can turn in the assignment multiple times, but only the last version you submitted will be graded.
